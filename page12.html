    <br>
<p1> This project speaks alot to me as I have recently gotten out of a toxic relationship. 
  <br>
  This journal entails what I have gone through and served as some sense of closure/more self-reflection.
  <br>
  With a very supportive system of family and friends, I was able to see myself in a new positive light.
  <br>
  Now, I am working towards my goals like doing well in college 
  <br>
  while balancing working a job related to my future career field.
  <br>
  Not only do I hope to tell my story through my drawings and excerpts, 
  <br>
  but also the story of many other people who have also experienced the same.
  <br>
